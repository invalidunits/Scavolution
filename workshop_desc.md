# Scavenger Evolution

**Scavolution** is a mod which allows you to upgrade your scavengers by giving them certain items. Scavengers now have a new goal to deposit certain items in dens. After a sucessful deposit (or if the cycle ends with the item in their hand), the scavenger will **evolve** into a new varient. Scavengers will express there gratitude by becoming friendly towards you after helping them evolve. You can use this to obtain items usually unobtainable or very hard to obtain for most Slugcats.

**Requires The Watcher.**

Scavenger + **Boomerang** => Scavenger **Templar**
**Elite** Scavenger + **Boomerang** => Scavenger **Disciple**
**Elite** Scavenger + **Karma flower** => Scavenger **Disciple**
**Templar** Scavenger + **Karma flower** => Scavenger **Disciple**


## RoadMap (❓ = Unimplemented  ✅ = Implemented )

- ✅ Evolving/Upgrading Scavengers.
- ❓ 
- ❓ Add new Scavenger varients through evolution. 
I have a couple of good scavenger Ideas, I'll leave the names of two them here, try to guess what they do 😉:
Scavenger Junior, Braided Scavenger, Imperial Scavenger.

- ❓ New passage: The Innovator
- ❓ Revive Scavengers? Possibly with Templar magic?
- ❓ New Echo in Garbage Wastes?
- ❓ Legendary Scavengers that would appear after evolving a large amount of scavengers in a region.


## Incompatibilities
    Likely RainMeadow because it messes around how scavengers are saved.
